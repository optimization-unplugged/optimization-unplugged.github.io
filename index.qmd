We aim to bring together experts and young researchers to discuss aspects of non-convex optimization that are related yet usually call for different mathematical tools: the study of landscapes, the analysis of algorithm dynamics, and the understanding of generalization in learning.

The schedule is kept light to favor interactions.
We encourage blackboard talks where appropriate---our venue is optimized for that!

The event is by invitation, but feel free to sign up to our [waiting list](https://forms.gle/ZNKZznecJfXsiMRXA).

---The organizers: [Nicolas Boumal](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/), [Lénaïc Chizat](https://lchizat.github.io/), [Nicolas Flammarion](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.flammarion) and [Andrew McRae](https://admcrae.github.io/).

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. |
