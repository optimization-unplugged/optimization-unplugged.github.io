We aim to bring together experts and young researchers to discuss aspects of non-convex optimization that are related yet usually call for different mathematical tools: the study of landscapes, the analysis of algorithm dynamics, and the understanding of generalization in learning.

The schedule is kept light to favor interactions.
We encourage blackboard talks where appropriate---the venue is optimized for that!

<!--The event is by invitation, but feel free to sign up to our [waiting list](https://forms.gle/ZNKZznecJfXsiMRXA).-->

---The organizers: [Nicolas Boumal](https://www.nicolasboumal.net/), [Lénaïc Chizat](https://lchizat.github.io/), [Nicolas Flammarion](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.flammarion) and [Andrew McRae](https://admcrae.github.io/).
