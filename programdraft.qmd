We aim to bring together experts and young researchers to discuss aspects of non-convex optimization that are related yet usually call for different mathematical tools: the study of landscapes, the analysis of algorithm dynamics, and the understanding of generalization in learning.

The schedule is kept light to favor interactions.
We encourage blackboard talks where appropriate---the venue is optimized for that!
